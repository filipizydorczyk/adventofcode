Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. You can find it at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

Its my first time solving these which I ma doing with help of my friends [@wrzesinski-hubert](https://github.com/wrzesinski-hubert) and [@maciekglowacki](https://github.com/maciekglowacki)
